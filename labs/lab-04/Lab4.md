3. By default, creative works are under exclusive copyright. If I publish code, I decide how others can use it. The point of open source software is for other people to use the code you've written. If I don't add a license (and my code is under exclusive copyright), then no one can use my code in any way without putting themselves at risk.

4. As before, creative works are under exclusive copyright by default. By using a project that does not have a license, I am opening myself up to all sorts of legal troubles.

5. This argument asserts that Gopher was beaten because it did not follow an open source model. Instead of releasing code to the public to decide the right thing, the Gopher team kept it private, which reduced the number of people that could improve Gopher. On top of that, Gopher was to require a licensing fee for .com domains but not for .edu domains. This violated trust of potential users. To me, this seems like a plausible argument. I don't think it's the only component (e.g. wrong model of hypertext), but it probably contributed to a significant extent.

6. .NET Core is "an open-source, general-purpose development platform" maintained by Microsoft. In addition, it is cross-platform. Interestingly, the .NET Foundation is developing it under an MIT license. This seems bizarre on first glance, as Microsoft has, historically, not written open source software. It does make sense, though; it is in Microsoft's interest to have the largest possible usage of their tooling. Releasing an open-source implementation under a very permissive license like the MIT License is in line with this goal.
